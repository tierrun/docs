# Report feature usage

Wire up your application to report the usage of a feature that your customer is entitled to consume.

### Before getting started

To get the most out of this quick-start guide, youâ€™ll need:

1. Stripe secret key
2. Select your pricing model & sync with Stripe
3. Basic auth implementation with auth guards
4. [Subscribed customers](/docs/quickstarts/initiate-subscription)
5. [Entitlement checks enabled](/docs/quickstarts/check-feature-access)
6. [Pricing Table](/docs/quickstarts/render-pricing-table) (optional)

You will never have to sync any Tier or pricing-specific details to your DB, Tier will ensure that you get the most updated pricing and usage data, except user data.

## 1. Initialize Tier SDK

Initialize the Tier SDK, ideally in a singleton design pattern, with both `TIER_BASE_URL` and `TIER_API_KEY` environment variables set with the prescribed values.

```js
// To make use of Tier Cloud Alpha you need to
// points base URL to the Tier API server
TIER_BASE_URL = 'https://api.tier.run'
// and set Tier API Key as your Stripe secret key
TIER_API_KEY = 'sk_test_51...'
```

<CodeGroup title="Initialize Tier">

```js
import tier from 'tier'
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Report usage of a feature

Once you have done an [entitlement check](/quickstarts/check-feature-access) for the user, you can give access to the feature, and once the user has consumed the feature you can report the feature usage to Tier.

<CodeGroup title="Report usage of a feature">

```js
await tier.report('org:customer-id-from-your-db',
	'feature:feature-id',
	 1 // This is the unit of feature consumption,
	{
		at: new Date('23 March 2023'),
		clobber: true // If you want the usage amount to override any previously reported usage of the feature for the current phase
	}
);
```

</CodeGroup>

## 3. Use Answer response of `can()` for reporting usage (optional)

If you used `can()` for the [entitlement check](/quickstarts/check-feature-access), then you can use the response of this check to report usage

<CodeGroup title="Report usage using response of `can()`">

```js
const access = await tier.can(
  'org:customer-id-from-your-db',
  'feature:feature-from-base-plan'
)

if (access.ok) {
  // Give access to the feature here
  access.report() // Report feature usage here
} else {
  // Handle restriction and even upselling here.
}
```

</CodeGroup>

This quickstart will give you an idea of how to register your customer in Tier. You can also refer to our SDK references to understand more about `can()` and `report()`.
