# Mapping to Stripe

This document explains what specifically is created in Stripe based on various pricing.json options.

## Quick Summary

| Tier pricing.json field | Stripe Field or Object                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `plan` and `feature`    | `Product` and `Price`                                     |
| `feature.base`          | flat-rate usage `Price`                                   |
| `feature.tiers`         | metered usage `Price`                                     |
| `feature.interval`      | `Price.interval`                                          |
| `feature.aggregate`     | `Price.aggregate_usage`, also known as "Aggregation mode" |
| `tier.upto`             | `upto` value on `Price` tier                              |
| `tier.price`            | per-unit cost for `Price` tier                            |
| `tier.base`             | flat-rate cost for `Price` tier |

Note: nothing is created in Stripe until `tier push` is run. Also, everything Tier does is in test mode until `tier push --live` is run, which requires an additional permission step, so this is all very safe to play around with.

## Plans and Features -> Products and Prices

Each `plan` in the `pricing.json` file will be used to create a subscription in Stripe. To facilitate this, each unique combination of `plan` and `feature` results in a `Product` and `Price` being created in Stripe.

Tier handles all of the details of creating these objects appropriately, so that they match the intent expressed in your `pricing.json` model.

For example, consider this `pricing.json` file:

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:name@title0": {
      "title": "This is a plan with a title",
      "features": {
        "feature:empty": {
          "title": "feature title goes here"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will create a single `Product` in Stripe with a single `Price` attached.

Additional metadata is attached to each Product and Price for Tier's usage later.

## Usage Pricing vs Flat Rate

When a feature has a `"base"` price, and no `"tiers"`, then Tier will create the Price in Stripe as a flat rate, rather than usage-based.

For example, this feature in `pricing.json` will produce the following Product and Price in Stripe:

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:example@1": {
      "title": "Just an example plan to show off features",
      "features": {
        "feature:base:only": {
          "base": 1000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, if `"tiers"` are defined, then Tier will create the appropriate Product and Price in Stripe to reflect this. For example:

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:example@1": {
      "title": "Just an example plan to show off features",
      "features": {
        "feature:graduated": {
          "tiers": [
            {
              "upto": 10
            },
            {
              "upto": 20,
              "price": 100
            },
            {
              "price": 50
            }
          ],
          "mode": "graduated"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Feature Limits and Overages

In Stripe, every tier-based price must include a final tier with an `"upto"` value of `Infinity`. However, Tier allows you to set a maximum amount of usage in a `pricing.json` file.

In order to store this in Stripe's system, Tier creates the Price using the last feature tier as unbounded, and sets the `tier.limit` metadata.

```json
{
  "plans": {
    "plan:example@1": {
      "title": "Just an example plan to show off features",
      "interval": "@daily",
      "features": {
        "feature:daily": {
          "tiers": [
            {
              "base": 1,
              "upto": 10
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note the highlighted sections above. From Stripe's point of view, the feature is effectively free for any amount of usage (after a base price of $0.01). But, the `tier.limit` metadata tells us that we should only allow the user to consume 10 units before considering their account to be in an overage state.
