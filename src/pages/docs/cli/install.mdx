# Installing Tier CLI

Tier can either be installed as a static binary, or run from source with `go`.

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install tierrun/tap/tier
```

### Binary (macOS, linux, Windows)

Binaries for major architectures can be found [on Github](https://tier.run/releases).

### Go (most operating systems and architectures)

If `go1.19` or later is installed, run or install tier like:

```bash
go run tier.run/cmd/tier@latest
```

or

```bash
go install tier.run/cmd/tier@latest
```
