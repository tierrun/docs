Tier will:
- Give you an opinionated way to implement pricing
- Limit the number of systems and data you have to deal with
- Work within your existing architecture/app
- Keep you from having to do anything custom or one-off
- Provide a single place to handle anything related to pricing, billing, subscriptions, entitlements, metering, etc.

Tier implements [PriceOps best practices](https://priceops.org/) for you.

Please read about our [architecture](/tier-concept/architecture) for more information.
